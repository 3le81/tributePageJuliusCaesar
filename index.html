            <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Julius Caesar's life:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>July 100 BC</strong> - Born in Rome, Italy. His full name
                was Gaius Julius Caesar.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>85 BC</strong> - Caesar's father died suddenly, so Caesar
                was the head of the family at 16 and soon came under threat as
                Lucius Cornelius Sulla became dictator. Sulla set about purging Rome
                of his enemies. Hundreds were killed or exiled, and Caesar was on
                the list. His mother's family pleaded for his life; Sulla
                reluctantly gave in, but stripped Caesar of his inheritance. From
                then on, lack of money was one of the main problems in his life.<br />
                At the age of 17 he married Cornelia, the daughter of a powerful
                politician in Rome.<br />
                Caesar joined the army, and left Rome.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>78 BC</strong> - Caesar returned to Rome after Sulla's
                death. On his return to Rome he was elected military tribune, a
                first step in a political career.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>69 BC</strong> - He was elected quaestor. His wife Cornelia
                died that year. After her funeral, Caesar went to serve his
                quaestorship in Spain.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>67 BC</strong> - Caesar returned to Rome and he married
                Pompeia (a grand-daughter of Sulla), whom he later divorced.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>63 BC</strong> - He ran for election to the post of Pontifex
                Maximus, high priest of the Roman state religion. He ran against two
                powerful senators; there were accusations of bribery by all sides.
                Caesar won comfortably, despite his opponents' greater experience
                and standing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>62/59 BC</strong> - He was appointed to govern Roman Spain.
                In Spain he conquered two local tribes, was hailed as imperator by
                his troops, and completed his governorship in high esteem. Though he
                was due a 'triumph' in Rome, he also wanted to stand for Consul, the
                most senior magistracy in the Republic. Faced with the choice
                between a triumph and the consulship, Caesar chose the consulship.
                After election, he was a consul in 59 BC.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>60/53 BC</strong> - Caesar took power with Gnaeus Pompeius
                Magnus (Pompey the Great) and Marcus Licinius Crassus. These three
                men ruled Rome in an informal alliance, known as the First
                Triumvirate.<br />
                With the agreement of his partners, Caesar became the governor of
                Gallia (Gaul).<br />
                Caesar was the commander of the Roman legions during the Gallic War.
                The war was fought on the side of Rome's Gallic clients against the
                Germans, who wanted to invade Gaul. It was also to extend Rome's
                control of Gaul. Caesar's conquest of Gaul extended Rome's territory
                to the North Sea.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>55 BC</strong> - Caesar conducted the first Roman invasion
                of Britain, and he wrote about this eight-year war in his book 'De
                Bello Gallico'. This book, written in Latin, is an important
                historical account.<br />
                These achievements gave him great military power, and threatened to
                eclipse Pompey. The balance of power was further upset by the death
                of Crassus in 53 BC.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>50 BC</strong> - The Senate, led by Pompey, ordered Caesar
                to disband his army and return to Rome because his term as governor
                had finished. Caesar thought he would be prosecuted if he entered
                Rome without the immunity enjoyed by a magistrate. Pompey accused
                Caesar of insubordination and treason.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>49 BC</strong> - Caesar and his army approached Rome and
                crossed the Rubicon, a shallow river in north-east Italy. It was the
                point beyond which no army was supposed to go. The river marked the
                boundary between Cisalpine Gaul to the north, and Italy proper to
                the south. Crossing the Rubicon caused a civil war.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>49/48 BC</strong> - Pompey, the lawful Consul, and his
                friends, fled from Rome as Caesar's army approached.<br />
                Pompey managed to escape before Caesar could capture him. Caesar
                decided to head for Spain, while leaving Italy under the control of
                Mark Antony. Caesar made an astonishing 27-day route-march to Spain,
                where he defeated Pompey's lieutenants. He then returned east, to
                challenge Pompey in Greece. There, in July 48 BC, at Dyrrhachium
                Caesar barely avoided a catastrophic defeat. He then decisively
                defeated Pompey, at the Battle of Pharsalus later that year.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>48/47 BC</strong> - In Rome, Caesar was appointed Dictator,
                with Mark Antony as his Master of the Horse (second in command).
                Caesar presided over his own election to a second consulship and
                then, after eleven days, resigned this dictatorship. Late in 48 BC,
                he was appointed dictator again, with a term of one year. Caesar
                then pursued Pompey to Egypt, where Pompey was soon murdered. Caesar
                then became involved in an Egyptian civil war between the child
                pharaoh and his sister, wife, and co-regent queen, Cleopatra.
                Perhaps as a result of the pharaoh's role in Pompey's murder, Caesar
                sided with Cleopatra. Caesar defeated the pharaoh's forces in 47 BC
                and installed Cleopatra as ruler. Caesar and Cleopatra celebrated
                their victory with a triumphant procession on the Nile in the spring
                of 47 B.C. The royal barge was accompanied by 400 additional ships,
                introducing Caesar to the luxurious lifestyle of the Egyptian
                pharaohs. Caesar and Cleopatra never married; Roman Law only
                recognized marriages between two Roman citizens. Caesar continued
                his relationship with Cleopatra, which lasted 14 years. Cleopatra
                visited Rome on more than one occasion, staying in Caesar's villa,
                outside Rome across the River Tiber.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>46 BC</strong> - Caesar defeated Cato and the remnants of
                Pompey's supporters in Africa. He was then appointed dictator for
                ten years. In two years he made numerous changes in Roman
                administration to improve the Republic. Many of these changes were
                meant to improve the lives of ordinary people. The most important
                change, however, was his reform of the calendar. The calendar was
                then regulated by the movement of the moon, and this had left it in
                a mess. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar,
                which was regulated by the sun. This calendar is almost identical to
                the current Western calendar.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>44 BC</strong> - In February, one month before his
                assassination, he was appointed Dictator for life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>15 March 44 BC</strong> - On the Ides of March (15 March) of
                44 BC, Caesar was due to appear at a session of the Senate. Mark
                Antony, fearing the worst, went to head Caesar off. The plotters
                expected this, and arranged for someone to intercept him.<br />
                According to Eutropius, around sixty or more men participated in the
                assassination. The dictator's last words are not known with
                certainty. The version best known in the English-speaking world is
                the Latin phrase Et tu, Brute? ('You too, Brutus?'). In
                Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, this is the first half of the line: "Et
                tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar". Caesar's dead body lay where it fell
                on the Senate floor for nearly three hours before other officials
                arrived to remove it.<br />
                Brutus and his companions then marched to the Capitol while crying
                out to their beloved city: "People of Rome, we are once again
                free!". They were met with silence, as the citizens of Rome had
                locked themselves inside their houses as soon as the rumour of what
                had taken place had begun to spread.<br />
                Caesar's body was cremated, and on the site of his cremation, the
                Temple of Caesar was erected a few years later (at the east side of
                the main square of the Roman Forum).
